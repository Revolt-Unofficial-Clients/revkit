# Introduction

The [Revolt Unofficial Clients](https://github.com/Revolt-Unofficial-Clients) group believes that custom clients should use some form of standardization. This section (and this package) is meant to help with that.

Most functions should use (or try to use) what Revite uses. (for example themes, use the revite `appearance` settings key, don't make your own!)
